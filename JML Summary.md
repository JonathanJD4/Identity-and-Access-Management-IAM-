Joiner: 
A person joining a company

Mover:
A person changing their role e.g promotion, changing department etc...
- Amending access for the person so they have the right level of access for their new role/department
- Removing access for what is no longer needed (As IAM policy is a user is given the minimal level of access/permissions to carry out their job)

Leaver:
A person leaving the company or dismissed
- Removing access for the user completely on their last day so that they can't access company resources afterwards
- If dismissed access to company resources must be revoked immediately
